**Diversity in Academia: The Women in Neuroscience Repository (WiNRepo)** <a name=winrepo></a> \
Speakers: Ana Luísa Pinho and Anibal Sólon

Gender equity in academia, namely in neuroscience, is still far to be reached. Women generally encounter more obstacles preventing them to pursue their research career as it is revealed by the higher career-switching rate than their male counterparts. One key aspect about gender inequality is the under-representation of women in scientific public demonstrations, as organizers, speakers, reviewers or attendees. The Women in Neuroscience Repository (WiNRepo - www.winrepo.org) was launched in 2018 with the intent to promote the visibility of women's neuroscientists at conferences and other scientific events. Originally conceived as a list of women's profiles active in the research field of neuroscience, the website offers now the possiblity to create users' accounts with a view to form, in the long-term, a social-media network for content-sharing and collaboration on DEI in academia, with a special focus in gender balance. In this presentation, we will pinpoint key aspects related to the elaboration of these new accounts features and provide guidelines on how to collaborate with us for the development of future features.
