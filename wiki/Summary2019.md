The focus of our event this year was an intro to neuroimaging analysis, deep learning, and of course open science. To that end, we had a few awards to hand out:
* Most Innovative Project (based on novelty, feasibility, and application): What do brain sound like?
* Best Open Science Project (project making use of and contributes to open science platforms): AFIDS Validator & Artifically Intelligent Autobiographical Interviews
* Most Enthusiastic Team (teamwork, motivation, collaboration): Is deeper better?
