Brainhack Western 2021 saw our first hybrid brainhack with almost 70 in-person attendees and approximately 10 virtual attendees.  Attendees came from all levels of academia and from almost twenty different departments across the Western University campus.

The Brainhack Western 2021 schedule included seven tutorials covering topics such as dealing with MRI data in Python, an Intro to fMRI, an Introduction and live demo of fNIRS, and Machine and Deep learning.  New tutorials for 2021 included an Intro to Datalad and an Intro to Meta-analyses for neuroimaging data.

We had four projects pitched, all of which made considerable progress during the event.  Congratulations to our prize-winning projects:

* Best Use of Open Science: Fetal skull-stripping
* Most Enthusiastic Team: BIDS-events
* Most Innovative: QC App

Our new initiative to have project members who were not involved in the project pitch present the project at hacking project wrap-up was successful.  It allowed project team members who maybe were not comfortable making significant contributions to the project itself play a key role in conveying what the initial problem was and how the team approached a solution both to the judges and other attendees.

A huge thanks to the Brainhack Western 2022 Organizing Committee chairs and volunteers, as well as our faculty judges.
