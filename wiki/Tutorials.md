### Working with MRI Data in Python <a name=image_manip></a>

Organizer: Brad Karat

#### Synposis
This tutorial will teach one to manipulate and transform neuroimaging data using Python with commonly used. First, an understanding of how MRI data is represented in Python will be discussed followed by hands-on tasks such as basic manipulation of neuroimaging MRI data. All content will be performed using Jupyter notebooks in the spirit of reproducible and open science!

### Intro to Datalad <a name=datalad></a>

Organizer: Tristan Kuehn

#### Synopsis:
DataLad, “a free and open-source data management system for everyone,” is a powerful tool for obtaining data, managing your own research data, and exposing your data to others. This tutorial will start by introducing the basics of DataLad, then we’ll use it to download some open data that may be useful for a Brainhack project. We’ll process that data and use DataLad to keep track of the resulting derivatives, and show how to make that data available to collaborators.

### Intro to fMRI <a name=fmri></a>

Organizer: Suzanne Witt

#### Synposis
This tutorial will start with an overview of fMRI, including the underlying contrast mechanism, scanning, task design, standard preprocessing steps, basic processing, and results interpretation. The overview will shift to cover the BIDS app, fMRIPrep. Various ways to run fMRIPrep will be shown, however, due to time constraints, fMRIPrep will not be run in real time. Time will be spent discussing the output of fMRIPrep, including going through a real output report.

### Intro to Meta-analyses for neuroimaging data <a name=metaanalysis></a>

Organizer: Suzanne Witt

#### Synopsis
Meta-analyses of neuroimaging data are a good way to get started with understanding neuroimaging and task-based neural processing. This tutorial will cover the various aspects of designing a meta-analysis and some of the more popular methods, including both topic- and contrast-based meta-analyses and coordinate- and image-based meta-analyses. Some hands-on work with the python-based tool NiMARE with a sample dataset will be included to help attendees appreciate some of the nuances between the various types of meta-analyses.

### Intro to Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) <a name=fnirs></a>

Organizers: Culham Lab

#### Synopsis

In this session, you will get an overview of fNIRS (functional near-infrared spectroscopy). fNIRS is a relatively new neuroimaging method, that has gained in popularity over the last 20 years. fNIRS uses an array of light sensors on the surface of the scalp to detected oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodflow in cortex. fNIRS is low-cost, minimally invasive, offers reasonable spatial and temporal resolution, and is easily combined with other neuroimaging methods. In this session, we’ll discuss fNRIS methodology and applications, as well as the current state of affairs for fNIRS analysis. There will be a live-demonstration of the fNIRS system, as well as some hands-on experience with analyzing fNRIS data using the Matlab-based toolbox, Homer.

### Intro to Machine Learning <a name=ml></a>

Organizer: Mehrdad Kashefi

This tutorial will define the basic concepts of machine learning followed by an introduction to the general blocks of a machine learning pipeline using an example neural dataset.

### Intro to Deep Learning <a name=dl></a>

Organizer: Haider Al-Tahan

#### Synposis

This tutorial will start with a brief introduction and then focus on hands-on experience with Tensorflow. Topics will include: 1)organization of code into classes, functions, and the Tensorgraph; 2) examples of dense and convolutional networks for real problems using high-level Tensorflow tools such as built-in Keras functions; and 3) an open session for exploring and adapting existing NNs or for helping attendees build their own networks.
