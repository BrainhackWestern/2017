Brainhack Western 2022 was our first fully in-person brainhack after the COVID-19 pandemic with almost 80 in-person attendees and approximately 10 virtual attendees.  Attendees came from all levels of academia and from almost twenty different departments across the Western University campus.

The Brainhack Western 2022 schedule included eleven tutorials covering topics such as dealing with MRI data in Python, an Intro to EEG analyses, Modern considerations for analyzing behavioral data, and Demystifying Git and GitHub.  Additionally, we had a panel discussion on diversity in data and unintended racial bias in large, open datasets.  

We had four projects pitched, all of which made considerable progress during the event.  Congratulations to our prize-winning projects:

* Best Use of Open Science: Functional Atlas Explorer
* Most Enthusiastic Team: DWI Fiducials
* Most Innovative: Brain3DVis: AR/MR MRI Visualizer 

We continued our initiative from 2022 to have project members who were not involved in the project pitch present the project at hacking project wrap-up was successful.  This continuedd to allow project team members who maybe were not comfortable making significant contributions to the project itself play a key role in conveying what the initial problem was and how the team approached a solution both to the judges and other attendees.

A huge thanks to the Brainhack Western 2022 Organizing Committee chairs and volunteers, as well as our faculty judges.
