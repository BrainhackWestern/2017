              This tutorial will teach one to manipulate and transform neuroimaging data
              using Python with commonly used. First, an understanding of how MRI data
              is represented in Python will be discussed followed by hands-on tasks such
              as basic manipulation of neuroimaging MRI data. All content will be
              performed using Jupyter notebooks in the spirit of reproducible and open
              science!

              In this tutorial, minimally preprocessing of functional data using
              `fmriprep` will be discussed and the steps the tool performs. Following
              preprocessing, the data will be cleaned and made workable through motion
              cleaning and dimensionality reduction. The final component of the
              tutorials involves functional connectivity analysis. All content will be
              performed using Jupyter notebooks in the spirit of reproducible and open
              science! It is recommended (though not required) to attend the
              [Working with MRI Data in Python](#python) tutorial.

              In this session, you will get an overview of fNIRS (functional
              near-infrared spectroscopy), and see a live demonstration of fNIRS data
              acquisition and analysis. fNIRS is a relatively new neuroimaging method,
              that has gained in popularity over the last 20 years. fNIRS uses an array
              of light sensors on the surface of the scalp to detected oxygenated and
              deoxygenated bloodflow in cortex. fNIRS is low-cost, minimally invasive,
              offers reasonable spatial and temporal resolution, and is easily combined
              with other neuroimaging methods. In this session, weâ€™ll discuss fNRIS
              methodology and applications, as well as the current state of affairs for
              fNIRS analysis.

              This tutorial will be broken up into a theoretical (~1hr) and practical
              component (~2hr). The theoretical component will provide:
                1) A basic overview of neural networks (NNs) and backpropagation, 
                2) An overview of several key NN architectures including convolutional 
                   and recurrent networks, 
                3) An open discussion of active areas of NN research. 

              The practical component of this tutorial will focus on hands-on experience
              with Tensorflow. Topics will include 
                1) Organization of code into classes, functions, and the Tensorgraph, 
                2) Examples of dense and convolutional networks for real problems using 
                   high-level Tensorflow tools such as built-in Keras functions, 
                3) An open session for exploring and adapting existing NNs or for 
                   helping attendees build their own networks.
