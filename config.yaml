              This tutorial will teach one to manipulate and transform neuroimaging data
              using Python with commonly used. First, an understanding of how MRI data
              is represented in Python will be discussed followed by hands-on tasks such
              as basic manipulation of neuroimaging MRI data. All content will be
              performed using Jupyter notebooks in the spirit of reproducible and open
              science!

            description: |
              This tutorial will start with an overview of fMRI, including the
              underlying contrast mechanism, scanning, task design, standard
              preprocessing steps, basic processing, and results interpretation.
              The overview will shift to cover the BIDS app, fMRIPrep. Various
              ways to run fMRIPrep will be shown, however, due to time constraints, 
              fMRIPrep will not be run in real time. Time will be spent discussing 
              the output of fMRIPrep, including going through a real output report.

            description: |
              Meta-analyses of neuroimaging data are a good way to get started with
              understanding neuroimaging and task-based neural processing. This tutorial
              will cover the various aspects of designing a meta-analysis and some of the more
              popular methods, including both topic- and contrast-based meta-analyses and 
              coordinate- and image-based meta-analyses. Some hands-on work with the 
              python-based tool NiMARE with a sample dataset will be included to help
              attendees appreciate some of the nuances between the various types of
              meta-analyses.

            description: |
              In this session, you will get an overview of fNIRS (functional
              near-infrared spectroscopy). fNIRS is a relatively new neuroimaging method,
              that has gained in popularity over the last 20 years. fNIRS uses an array
              of light sensors on the surface of the scalp to detected oxygenated and
              deoxygenated bloodflow in cortex. fNIRS is low-cost, minimally invasive,
              offers reasonable spatial and temporal resolution, and is easily combined
              with other neuroimaging methods. In this session, weâ€™ll discuss fNRIS
              methodology and applications, as well as the current state of affairs for
              fNIRS analysis. There will be a live-demonstration of the fNIRS system, 
              as well as some hands-on experience with analyzing fNRIS data using
              the Matlab-based toolbox, Homer.

              This tutorial will start with a brief introduction and then focus on 
              hands-on experience with Tensorflow. Topics will include 
                1) Organization of code into classes, functions, and the Tensorgraph, 
                2) Examples of dense and convolutional networks for real problems using 
                   high-level Tensorflow tools such as built-in Keras functions, 
                3) An open session for exploring and adapting existing NNs or for 
                   helping attendees build their own networks.
